# gcpPubSubExample
Scala code sample to subscribe GCP Pub/Sub service and consume messages.
The code does not include authentication part, we assume ADC is used.
To get started, replace project id and subscription id with your GCP setting:
Aka.
  val projectId: String = ""
  val subscriptionId: String = ""
